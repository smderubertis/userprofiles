takehome assessment

DNF:
  - Did not finish all REST endpoints (or test)
  - Did not begin front-end

The initial idea was to expose REST API w/spring-boot and consume endpoints w/create-react-app, using JSON Web Token for authentication.

Pain points/obstacles that consumed the most time:
  - Deciding "quickest" stack
  - learning Spring-Boot
  - config hell, mysql client connection issues
